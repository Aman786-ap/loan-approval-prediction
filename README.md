# Loan Approval Prediction

A machine learning project to predict loan approval based on applicant data using Python.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not. It includes:

- Data preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Feature encoding and scaling
- Train-test split
- Model training and evaluation
- Predicting new loan applications

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** – Programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning (Random Forest, train-test split, scaling)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Joblib** – Saving trained models

---

## 📁 Dataset

- Dataset file: `loan_data.csv`
- Contains features like:
  - `Gender`, `Married`, `Dependents`, `Education`, `Self_Employed`
  - `ApplicantIncome`, `CoapplicantIncome`, `LoanAmount`, `Loan_Amount_Term`, `Credit_History`, `Property_Area`
- Target variable: `Loan_Status` (1 = Approved, 0 = Not Approved)

🔮 Predicting New Loans

You can predict a new loan application by providing the input features in the notebook.
The model outputs whether the loan is Approved or Not Approved.

If you want, I can also **write a short `.gitignore` file** for your project so you won’t push unnecessary files like Jupyter checkpoints or Python caches.  

Do you want me to do that?
